Hi!

This is my attempt at getting Xapian to be usable from Haskell. What I'm doing
is writing a C wrapper to Xapian, and then exposing this in Haskell with the FFI
support.

To get going, here's what you'll need to do:

    cd cbits
    make
    cd ..
    mv cbits/libcxapian.so .

Which will generate "libcxapian" (which may need a better name). You can then
use this with Xapian.hs:

    ghci -isrc -lcxapian -L.

And away you go! There are some examples of how far we've got in the `examples`
directory.



ACHTUNG! WARNING! HERE BE GREMLINS!

I'm currently learning Haskell, so I don't know the "right" way of doing some
things, I just do enough to get a result for now. Feel free to rip it apart and
change the API as much as you like. My C is even worse :) I don't really enjoy C
programming so that could well be bug ridden (though I will say, the current C
is even worse than what I'd normally write... anything for results at the
moment!)

TODO

    - We're are almost entirely trapped in the IO monad - should we be? Could
      we move some stuff to the ST monad and act more pure?

    - ...lots more :)
